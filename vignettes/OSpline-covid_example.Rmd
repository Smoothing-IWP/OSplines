# COVID-19 Example

## Data and Model

We will illustrate the use of O-spline using the `covid_canada` dataset, which contains the daily death count of COVID-19 in Canada.

```{r}
head(covid_canada)
```

For simplicity, let's consider the following model:
\[Y_i|\lambda_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i)\]
\[\log(\lambda_i) = \mathbf{x}_i^T\boldsymbol{\beta} + f(t_i)\]
where $\mathbf{x}_i$ denotes the fixed effect of weekdays, and $f$ is an unknown function to be inferred.

To make inference of the unknown function $f$, we use the $\text{IWP}_3(\sigma)$ model:
\[\frac{\partial^p{f}(t)}{\partial t^p} = \sigma \xi(t),\]
with the boundary (initial) conditions that $\frac{\partial^q{f}(0)}{\partial t^q} = 0$ for all $0\leq q <p$.
Here $\xi(t)$ is the standard Gaussian white noise process, or can be viewed as the distributional derivative of the standard Brownian motion.

## Inference

To fit the above model using the OSpline package, we simply do the following:
```{r warning=FALSE}
fit_result <- model_fit(new_deaths ~ weekdays1 + weekdays2 + weekdays3 + weekdays4 + weekdays5 + weekdays6 +
                          f(smoothing_var = t, model = "IWP", order = 3, k = 100, sd.prior = list(prior = "exp", para = list(u = 0.02, alpha = 0.5))), 
                        data = covid_canada, method = "aghq", family = "Poisson")
```

We can take a look at the posterior summary of this model:
```{r}
summary(fit_result)
```


We can also see the inferred function $f$:
```{r warning=FALSE}
plot(fit_result)
```

We can use the `predict` function to obtain the posterior summary of $f$ or its derivative at `new_data`:

For the function $f$:
```{r warning=FALSE}
predict_f <- predict(fit_result, variable = "t", newdata = data.frame(t = seq(from = 605, to = 615, by = 0.1)))
predict_f %>% ggplot(aes(x = x)) + geom_line(aes(y = mean), lty = "solid") +
  geom_line(aes(y = plower), lty = "dashed") +
  geom_line(aes(y = pupper), lty = "dashed") +
  theme_classic() + xlim(c(605,615)) + ylim(0,6)
```


For the first derivative:
```{r warning=FALSE}
predict_f1st <- predict(fit_result, variable = "t", newdata = data.frame(t = seq(from = 605, to = 615, by = 0.1)), degree = 1)
predict_f1st %>% ggplot(aes(x = x)) + geom_line(aes(y = mean), lty = "solid") +
  geom_line(aes(y = plower), lty = "dashed") +
  geom_line(aes(y = pupper), lty = "dashed") +
  theme_classic() + xlim(c(605,615)) + ylim(c(-3,5))
```


For the second derivative:
```{r warning=FALSE}
predict_f2nd <- predict(fit_result, variable = "t", newdata = data.frame(t = seq(from = 605, to = 617, by = 0.1)), degree = 2)
predict_f2nd %>% ggplot(aes(x = x)) + geom_line(aes(y = mean), lty = "solid") +
  geom_line(aes(y = plower), lty = "dashed") +
  geom_line(aes(y = pupper), lty = "dashed") +
  theme_classic()
```



## Inference with R-INLA

A similar model with an IWP component could be fitted using the software [R-INLA](https://www.r-inla.org/). Instead of using an O-Spline approximation, the R-INLA software uses the augmented space approach to fit the IWP component. The R-INLA software implements two possible choices of the IWP model: the first order IWP (`crw1`) or the second order IWP (`crw2`). 

Since the third IWP is not compatible with the R-INLA software, here we use the second order IWP as an example:

To fit the model and make inference of the function $f$:

```{r}
if(requireNamespace("INLA", quietly=TRUE)) {

  inla_result <- INLA::inla(formula = new_deaths~-1 + weekdays1 + weekdays2 + weekdays3 + weekdays4 + weekdays5 + weekdays6 + f(t, model = "crw2", constr = F, hyper = list(prec = list(prior = "pc.prec", param = c(0.02, 0.5)))), data = covid_canada, family = "Poisson", control.compute=list(config = TRUE))
  
  inla_result$summary.random$t %>% filter(ID >= 0) %>% ggplot(aes(x = ID)) + geom_line(aes(y = mean), lty = "solid") +
  geom_line(aes(y = `0.025quant`), lty = "dashed") +
  geom_line(aes(y = `0.975quant`), lty = "dashed") +
  theme_classic() + xlim(c(605,615)) + ylim(0,6)
  
}

```



To make inference of the first derivative $f'$:

```{r}
if(requireNamespace("INLA", quietly=TRUE)) {

  inla_result$summary.random$t %>% filter(ID <= 0) %>% mutate(ID = -ID) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ID)) + geom_line(aes(y = mean), lty = "solid") +
  geom_line(aes(y = `0.025quant`), lty = "dashed") +
  geom_line(aes(y = `0.975quant`), lty = "dashed") +
  theme_classic() + xlim(c(605,615)) + ylim(c(-3,5))
  
}
```



The inferential result of the function $f$ using R-INLA is comparable to the result using `OSpline`  The inference of derivative, on the other hand, tends to be more wiggly using R-INLA. This difference is due to the lower order IWP used in the model. The highest order IWP that R-INLA accommodates is the second order IWP, which only assumes the function to be once differentiable, whereas the third order IWP used by `OSpline` assumes the function to be twice differentiable.
